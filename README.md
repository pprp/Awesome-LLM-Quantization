Welcome to the Awesome-LLM-Quantization repository! This is a curated list of resources related to quantization techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). Quantization is a crucial step in deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or edge devices, by reducing the model's size and computational requirements.

(2) Salience-Weighted Quantizer Calibration: by considering the element-wise salience within the group, Slim-LLM search for the calibration parameter $\gamma$ to prevent the degradation of local salient weight information in each group.<br />#MixedPrecision #2-bit                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

They first identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer. They find that soem **random rotations lead to better quantization** than others. Then, SpinQuant was proposed to optimize the rotation matrices with _Cayley_ optimization on validation dataset. Specifically, them employ Cayley SGD method to optimize the rotation matrix on the Stiefel manifold. <br />#PTQ #Rotation #4bit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This paper introduces DuQuant, a novel approach that utilizes rotation and permutation transformations to more effectively mitigate both massive and normal outliers. First, DuQuant starts by constructing rotation matrices, using specific outlier dimensions as prior knowledge, to redistribute outliers to adjacent channels by block-wise rotation. Second, We further employ a zigzag permutation to balance the distribution of outliers across blocks, thereby reducing block-wise variance. A subsequent rotation further smooths the activation landscape, enhancing model performance. DuQuant establishs new state-of-the-art baselines for 4-bit weight-activation quantization across various model types and downstream tasks. <br />#PTQ #Rotation #4bit #WA |
| Under Review <br/> [Scaling Laws for Mixed Quantization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06722v1.pdf) <br/> Zeyu Cao, Cheng Zhang, Pedro Gimenes, Jianqiao Lu, Jianyi Cheng, Yiren Zhao   | The paper examines the scaling law of mixed-precision quantization in large language models (LLMs). The key findings are: (1) As model size increases, the maximum achievable quantization ratio (ratio of low-precision to total parameters) increases under a fixed performance target. This suggests larger models can tolerate more aggressive quantization. (2) Finer granularity of quantization (e.g. per matrix multiplication vs per layer) allows for higher quantization ratios while maintaining performance. This is due to the irregular distribution of outliers in weights and activations. The authors formulate these observations as "LLM-MPQ Scaling Laws" and discuss the implications for future AI hardware design and efficient AI algorithms. <br/> #mixed #scaling-law |

It includes stages for sparsification, quantization, fine-tuning with neural low-rank adapter search (NLS), and sparse parameter-efficient fine-tuning (SparsePEFT) with optional quantization-awareness. SQFT addresses the challenges of merging sparse/quantized weights with dense adapters by preserving sparsity and handling different numerical precisions. <br/> #Quantization #Pruning #PEFT|
